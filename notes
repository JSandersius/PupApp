we'll use create-react-app to get our boilerplate 
we'll then use yarn to add our dependencies, AXIOS and React Router DOM 
next we'll add bootstrap to index.html file 

to begin we're going to import react from react --> in App.js 
	browser router as router and route
		both of these will come from the react router dom 

then setup router component --> in App.js 
then import the navbar, the footer and the wrapper components
	though footer and navabar compnents ae just for styling, so they're not too important 

And then import the three pages that we're going to be creating 
discover
about 
search 

Now, the compoents within the wrapper are going to be rendered depending on the path 
	This is where we'll use react router  

Ok, so settng this up is pretty easy, these components will only be set up if the path is EXACTLY matched
	if we were to leave out the exact property, the component will render at the path starting at the suggested path 

if you dont add a path, you can choose to render a component on no match whatsoever 
This give you the option to add a 404 page 
	 

Dont be too worried if this hasn't clicked yet, it will in a bit 

I'm now going to component files and simply add an h1 tag, including the name of the component so I can check to make sure the react router is working properly
