we'll use create-react-app to get our boilerplate 
we'll then use yarn to add our dependencies, AXIOS and React Router DOM 
next we'll add bootstrap to index.html file 

to begin we're going to import react from react --> in App.js 
	browser router as router and route
		both of these will come from the react router dom 

then setup router component --> in App.js 
then import the navbar, the footer and the wrapper components
	though footer and navabar compnents ae just for styling, so they're not too important
